If you're new in Open-source community there is nice guide how to start contributing to projects:

Checkout [development page](development.md) for more details about how to develop and run testkube on your machine.

## General guidance for contributing to Testkube project

You're very welcome to help in Testkube development ðŸ”¥, there is a lot of incoming work to do :).

We're trying hard to limit technical debt from the beginning so we defined simple rules when putting some code into Testkube repo.

### For golang based components

- Always use gofmt
- Follow golang good practices ([proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/)) in your code
- Tests are your friend (we will target 80% CC in our code)
- Use clean names, don't brake basic design patterns and rules.

### For infrastructure / Kubernetes based components

- Comment non-obvious decisions
- Use current Helm/Kubernetes versions

## Building diagrams

To build diagrams you'll need to install plantuml:

```sh
brew install plantuml # on mac
```

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y plantuml # on ubuntu linux 
```

```sh
pacman -S plantuml # on arch linux
```

Next run

```sh
make diagrams
```

to generate png files from puml files

TIP: If using vscode there is nice extension for live preview of plantuml files.
