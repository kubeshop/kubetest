# Getting Started

Please follow [install steps](/docs/installing.md) first for Testkube installation (if not installed already)

## Getting help

```sh
kubectl testkube --help 

# or for tests
kubectl testkube tests --help 
kubectl testkube testsuites --help 
```

## Defining tests

After installing you will need to add Tests to your cluster, which are created as Custom Resource in Kubernetes (access to Kubernetes cluster would be also needed)

For now Testkube only supports  *Postman collections*, *basic CURL execition* and *Cypress* - but we plan to handle more testing tools soon.

If you don't want to create Custom Resources "by hand" we have a little helper for this: 

### Creating Postman Collections based tests

Fist let's export Postman collection from Postman UI (file content should look similar to this one below):

```bash
cat <<EOF > my_postman_collection.json
{
	"info": {
		"_postman_id": "8af42c21-3e31-49c1-8b27-d6e60623a180",
		"name": "Kubeshop",
		"schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
	},
	"item": [
		{
			"name": "Home",
			"event": [
				{
					"listen": "test",
					"script": {
						"exec": [
							"pm.test(\"Body matches string\", function () {",
							"    pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include(\"K8s Accelerator\");",
							"});"
						],
						"type": "text/javascript"
					}
				}
			],
			"request": {
				"method": "GET",
				"header": [],
				"url": {
					"raw": "https://kubeshop.io/",
					"protocol": "https",
					"host": [
						"kubeshop",
						"io"
					],
					"path": [
						""
					]
				}
			},
			"response": []
		},
		{
			"name": "Team",
			"event": [
				{
					"listen": "test",
					"script": {
						"exec": [
							"pm.test(\"Status code is 200\", function () {",
							"    pm.response.to.have.status(200);",
							"});"
						],
						"type": "text/javascript"
					}
				}
			],
			"request": {
				"method": "GET",
				"header": [],
				"url": {
					"raw": "https://kubeshop.io/our-team",
					"protocol": "https",
					"host": [
						"kubeshop",
						"io"
					],
					"path": [
						"our-team"
					]
				}
			},
			"response": []
		}
	]
}
EOF
```

```sh
kubectl testkube tests create --file my_postman_collection.json --type postman/collection --name my-test-name 
```

**Note**: this is just an example of how it works. For further details you can visit [Postman documentation](executor-postman.md)

### Creating Cypress tests

Cypress are in form of projects, so to run them we need to pass whole directory structure with npm based dependencies. You can create new test with Testkube:

```sh
 kubectl testkube tests create --uri https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-cypress.git --git-branch jacek/feature/git-checkout --git-path examples --name test-name --type cypress/project
```

Where:

- `git-uri` is git uri where testkube will get cypress project
- `git-branch` is what branch should he checkout (default - main branch will be used)
- `git-path` is what path of repository should be checked out (testkube is doing partial git checkout so it'll be fast even for very big monorepos)
- `name` - is unique Sript Custom Resource name.
- `type` - cypress/project - for Cypress based project test structure

## Starting new test execution

When our test is defined as Custom Resource we can now run it:

```sh
kubectl testkube tests run my-test-name 

#  ... some test run output ...

Use following command to get test execution details:
kubectl testkube tests execution 611b6da38cd74034e7c9d408

or watch for completition with
kubectl testkube tests watch 611b6da38cd74034e7c9d408

```

## Getting execution details

After test completed with success or error you can go back to test details by running
tests execution command:

```sh
kubectl testkube tests execution 6103a45b7e18c4ea04883866

....
some execution details
```

## Getting available tests

To run test execution you'll need to know test name

```shell
kubectl testkube tests list

+----------------------+--------------------+
|         NAME         |        TYPE        |
+----------------------+--------------------+
| create-001-test      | postman/collection |
| envs1                | postman/collection |
| test-kubeshop        | postman/collection |
| test-kubeshop-failed | postman/collection |
| test-postman-script  | postman/collection |
+----------------------+--------------------+

```

## Getting available executions

```shell
kubectl testkube tests executions TEST_NAME

+------------+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
|   TEST     |        TYPE        |       EXECUTION ID       |      EXECUTION NAME       | STATUS   |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611a5a1a910ca385751eb2c6 | pt1                       | success  |
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611a5a40910ca385751eb2c8 | pt2                       | error    |
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611a5b6d910ca385751eb2ca | forcibly-frank-panda      | error    |
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611a5b83910ca385751eb2cc | slightly-merry-jennet     | error    |
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611b6d6c8cd74034e7c9d406 | frequently-expert-terrier | error    |
| parms-test | postman/collection | 611b6da38cd74034e7c9d408 | violently-fresh-elephant  | error    |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
```

## Changing output format

For lists and details you can use different output format (`--output` flag) for now we're supporting following formats:

- `RAW` - it's raw output from given executor (e.g. for Postman collection it's terminal text with colors and tables)
- `JSON` - test run data are encoded in JSON
- `GO` - go-template formatting (like in Docker and Kubernetes) you'll need to add `--go-template` flag with custom format (defaults to {{ . | printf("%+v") }} will help you check available fields)

(Keep in mind that we have plans for other output formats like junit etc. if it's something that you need please ping us)

## Deleting a test

For deleting a test there is `kubectl testkube tests delete TEST_NAME` command and also `--all` flag can be used to delete all.
