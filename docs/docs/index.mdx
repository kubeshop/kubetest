# Testkube

<p class="intro--index">
  <small>
    Testkube is a Kubernetes-native testing framework for Testers and Developers that allows you to automate the executions 
    of your existing testing tools inside your Kubernetes cluster, removing all the complexity from your CI/CD/GitOps pipelines.
  </small>
</p>

Tests are meant to be part of a cluster's state and can be executed as needed:

- Manually via kubectl CLI.
- Externally triggered via API (CI, external tooling, etc).
- Automatically on deployment of annotated/labeled services/pods/etc (WIP).

### Testkube helps you:

- Avoid vendor lock-in for test orchestration and execution in CI/CD pipelines.
- Make it easy to orchestrate and run any kinds of tests - functional, load/performance, security, compliance, etc.,
  in your clusters, without having to wrap them in docker-images or provide network access.
- Make it possible to decouple test execution from build processes, allowing engineers to run specific tests whenever needed.
- Centralize all test results in a consistent format for actionable QA analytics.
- Provide a modular architecture for adding new types of test scripts and executors.

### The main Testkube components are:

- Kubectl plugin - simple - installed w/o 3rd party repositories (like Krew etc), communicates with API server.
- API Server - Work orchestrator, Runs executors, gathers execution results.
- Custom Resource Descriptors (CRD) Operator - Watches Testkube Custom Resources (CR), handles changes, communicates with API Server.
- Executors - Run tests defined for specific runner, currently available for [Postman](4-test-types/executor-postman.md), [Cypress](4-test-types/executor-cypress.md), [K6](4-test-types/executor-k6.md) and [Curl](4-test-types/executor-curl.md).
- Results DB - For centralized test results management.
- A simple browser-based [User Interface](3-using-testkube/UI.md) for monitoring test results.
