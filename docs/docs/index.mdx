# What is Testkube?

Testkube is a Kubernetes-native testing framework for Testers, Developers and DevOps practitioners that allows you to automate the executions of your existing testing tools inside your Kubernetes cluster, removing all the complexity from your CI/CD pipelines.

With Testkube, tests are part of a cluster's state and can be executed as needed:

- ‚ú®Automatically on deployment of annotated/labeled Kubernetes objects (services, pods, etc)
- ‚è≤Ô∏è On a schedule
- üßë‚Äçüíª Manually via Testkube's CLI or Open Source Dashboard
- ‚ö° Externally triggered via API
