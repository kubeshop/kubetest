# Testkube Documentation

Welcome to our documentation!
This is the place where you'll find everything you need to get ramped up and start testing with Testkube.

## What is Testkube?

Testkube is a Kubernetes-native testing framework for Testers, Developers, and DevOps practitioners that allows you to automate the executions of your existing testing tools inside your Kubernetes cluster, removing all the complexity from your CI/CD pipelines.

## Advantages of Using Testkube
 
### ⚡ Testing Made <span style={{color:"red"}}>Faster</span>

- Simple network access and configuration for your testing tools by running your tests inside the cluster.
- Leverage native scalability of K8s to reduce CI/CD bottlenecks.
- What used to take 2 hours now takes 2 minutes.

### ✨ Testing Made <span style={{color:"red"}}>Easier</span>

- Store and retrieve test artifacts generated by your testing tools.
- Get a common place for reporting test results across all your testing tools.
- Run tests using multiple versions of your testing tools.

### 🧑‍💻 Testing Made <span style={{color:"red"}}>Modern</span>

- Integrated testing with GitOps and event-driven workflows.
- Create tests from our official Test Executor list or bring your own testing tool.
- Vendor neutrality to CI/CD vendors and testing tools.



<!---
With Testkube, tests are part of a cluster's state and can be executed as needed:

- ✨Automatically on deployment of annotated/labeled Kubernetes objects (services, pods, etc)
- ⏲️ On a schedule
- 🧑‍💻 Manually via Testkube's CLI or via Testkube's Dashboard
- ⚡ Externally triggered via API
