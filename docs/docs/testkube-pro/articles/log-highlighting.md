## Overview

In Testkube Pro, we highlight relevant keywords in logs for faster debugging. To use this feature, open execution details.

On this screen, all of the lines that may be relevant will be highlighted in the interface.

You may navigate through the highlighted lines with the arrows on top of the interface,
or using the scrollbar where all relevant lines are marked.
