# Benefits of using Testkube

Whether you want to simplify your company's DevOps workflows or empower your QA and Testing teams, Testkube provides your teams the power to:

- Avoid vendor lock-in for test orchestration and execution in CI/CD pipelines.
- Make it easy to orchestrate and run any kinds of tests - functional, load/performance, security, compliance, etc.,
  in your clusters, without having to wrap them in docker-images or provide network access.
- Make it possible to decouple test execution from build processes, allowing engineers to run specific tests whenever needed.
- Centralize all test results in a consistent format for actionable QA analytics.
- Provide a modular architecture for adding new types of test scripts and executors.
