# How do I install Testkube?

To install Testkube, you'll need to install Testkube CLI (which is currently available on MacOS, Linux, and Windows) and install Testkube's API in your cluster using Helm.

You can read more about how to install and get Testkube up and running by following the instructions in our [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md).
