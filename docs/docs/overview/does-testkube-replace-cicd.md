# Does Testkube replace my CI/CD?

The beauty of Testkube is that it improves your CI/CD pipeline!

There's different ways to integrate Testkube with your current CI/CD. You can directly use the CLI, or if you use GitHub, you can create GitHub Actions. Read more about the process [here](https://kubeshop.github.io/testkube/integrations/testkube-automation).

If you're familiar with GitOps, check the [ArgoCD integration guide](https://testkube.kubeshop.io/blog/a-gitops-powered-kubernetes-testing-machine-with-argocd-and-testkube) will be useful, and check or the [Flux integration guide](https://testkube.io/blog/flux-testkube-gitops-testing-is-here). The diagram of GitOps + Testkube would look like this:
