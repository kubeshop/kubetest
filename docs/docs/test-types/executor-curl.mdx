# cURL
Testkube is able to run cURL commands as tests.

## Abstraction over curl
Testkube executor provides an abstraction over curl, that allow you to create JSON-based curl test files. They allow you to combine curl command with expected results:

- `expected_status` allow you to assert specific status code is returned
- `expected_body` allow to validate the body of the response.

Below is an example of how to format the test:

```js
{
  "command": [
    "curl",
    "https://reqbin.com/echo/get/json",
    "-H",
    "'Accept: application/json'"
  ],
  "expected_status": "200",
  "expected_body": "{\"success\":\"true\"}"
}
```

You can also find this test in the Testkube repository: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/test/curl/curl.json

## Example test
In this example we will use the following curl test: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube/blob/main/test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json

```js
{
	"command": [
	  "curl",
	  "https://testkube.io/"
	],
	"expected_status": "200"
}
```

## Creating and running Test

<Tabs groupId="dashboard-cli">
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">

If you prefer to use Dashboard, just go to Tests, and click `Add a new test` button. Then you need to fill in the test Name, choose the test Type (`curl/test`), and then choose Test Source.

### File
In case of File source the test file is uploaded directly.

![curl test - creation dialog - file](../img/dashboard-curl-create-test-file.png)

### Git file
In case of Git file you need to fill in repository details - Git repository URI (in this case `https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube.git`), branch (`main`), and path to curl test in your repository (`test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json`). In this example, the repository is public, but in case of private ones you mwould need to additionally fill in Git credentials.

![curl test - creation dialog - git file](../img/dashboard-curl-create-test-git-file.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

If you prefer using the CLI, you can create the test with `testkube create test`.

You need to set:

- `--name` (for example, `curl-test`)
- `--type` (in this case `curl/test`)

And, then choose Test Content type based on Test Source you want to use:

### File

In case of File test source:

- `--test-content-type` (`file-uri`)
- `--file` (path to your curl test - in this case `test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json`)

```sh
testkube create test --name curl-test --type curl/test --test-content-type file-uri --file test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json
```

```sh title="Expected output:"
Test created testkube / curl-test 🥇
```

You can then run the test with `testkube run test curl-test`.

### Git file

- `--test-content-type` (`git-file`, so specific file will be checked out from the Git repository)
- `--git-uri` - repository URI (in case of this example, `https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube.git`)
- `--git-branch`
- `--git-path` - path to the k6 script in the repository (in this case `test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json`)

```sh
testkube create test --name curl-test --type curl/test --test-content-type git-file --git-uri https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube.git --git-branch main --git-path test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json
```

```sh title="Expected output:"
Test created testkube / curl-test 🥇
```

You can then run the test with `testkube run test curl-test`.

```sh
$ testkube run test curl-test
Type:              curl/test
Name:              curl-test
Execution ID:      6400870d237c189271627cfa
Execution name:    curl-test-1
Execution number:  1
Status:            running
Start time:        2023-03-02 11:22:53.0107448 +0000 UTC
End time:          0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
Duration:          



Test execution started
Watch test execution until complete:
$ kubectl testkube watch execution curl-test-1


Use following command to get test execution details:
$ kubectl testkube get execution curl-test-1
```

You can then watch the execution, or get the results after the execution is finished.

```sh

Name:       curl-test-3
Number:            3

Third option to create the Test is to use a Test CRD. If you already have the test created you can check definition in Dashboard (`Definition` tab in Test Settings). 

You can also get a definition while using `testkube create test` command by adding `--crd-only`.
In that case, the test won't be created, but the definition will be displayed.

Output:
```sh
testkube create test --name curl-test --type curl/test --test-content-type git-file --git-uri https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube.git --git-branch main --git-path test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json --crd-only
```

```yaml
apiVersion: tests.testkube.io/v3
kind: Test
metadata:
  name: curl-executor-smoke
  namespace: testkube
  labels:
    core-tests: executors
spec:
  type: curl/test
  content:
    type: git-file
    repository:
      type: git-file
      uri: https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube.git
      branch: main
      path: test/curl/executor-tests/curl-smoke-test.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When the Test CRD is saved to the yaml file it can then be applied directly with `kubectl apply -f SOME_FILE_NAME.yaml`.
