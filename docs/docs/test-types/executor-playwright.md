# Playwright

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is an end-to-end testing and automation framework developed by Microsoft. Starting from the Testkube Helm chart version 1.9.5, it is now possible to use Testkube to manage your Playwright tests inside your Kubernetes cluster.

## Running Playwright Tests

The Playwright Testkube runner pulls the test code from Git directories. When creating a new test, this needs to be configured via the `--git-*` flags.

### Create Test

```bash
$ testkube create test --git-branch lilla/feat/playwright-executor --git-uri https://github.com/vLia/testkube-tests.git --git-path "playwright" --name playwright-test-demo --type playwright/test

Test created testkube / playwright-test-demo ðŸ¥‡
```

### Run Test

```bash
$ testkube run test playwright-test-demo
Type:              playwright/test
Name:              playwright-test-demo
Execution ID:      63eb5948d2588841ffa577a0
Execution name:    playwright-test-demo-1
Execution number:  1
Status:            running
Start time:        2023-02-14 09:50:00.924165379 +0000 UTC
End time:          0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
Duration:          



Test execution started
Watch test execution until complete:
$ kubectl testkube watch execution playwright-test-demo-1


Use following command to get test execution details:
$ kubectl testkube get execution playwright-test-demo-1

```

To follow up with the results of the execution, you can either `watch` the execution while it is running or `get` the results of it after it is done, as seen in the commands printed out by the cli.

### Check Artifacts

To get a list of the created artifacts, use the following command:

```bash
$ testkube get artifact playwright-test-demo-1
  EXECUTION | NAME                  | SIZE (KB)  
------------+-----------------------+------------
            | playwright-report.zip |    180527  
```

These files were created and uploaded to the previously configured object storage. To download them, use the `testkube download artifact` command.

```bash
$ testkube download artifact playwright-test-demo-1 playwright-report.zip data
File data/playwright-report.zip downloaded.
```

## Special Requirements

Running tests in a containerized environment is convenient: it's simple, portable and increases the speed of development. There is a need to be aware of the limitations of this environment.

### Reports

Similarly to many other testing tools, Playwright provides the option to open a browser window for reports. It is important to make sure reporters are not opening additional windows. Please update your configuration files located at `playwright.config.js` or `playwright.config.ts`:

```bash
reporter: [
  ['html', { open: 'never' }]
],
```

Having this option on the default setting will not block the Testkube test runner, as the following environment variables are set on a Dockerfile-level, but it is still important to be mindful of these differences.

```bash
ENV CI=1
ENV PWTEST_SKIP_TEST_OUTPUT=1
```

### Using Different Playwright Versions

The Testkube Playwright executor supports only one version for now: 1.30.0. In case this does not suffice, the [container executor docs](https://kubeshop.github.io/testkube/test-types/container-executor/#creating-and-configuring-container-executor-playwright) contain instructions on how to set up your own executor with a different version of Playwright.
