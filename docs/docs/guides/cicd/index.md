# Using Testkube from CI/CD

You can trigger tests in Testkube from your CI/CD pipeline. This practice decouples running your tests from the CI/CD, removes all the complexity of, and speeds, up your CI.

We have different tutorials, whether you want to be CI driven or using GitOps approaches. Check the following tutorials: 

- [Github Actions](./github-actions.md)
- [GitOps Testing](./gitops/index.md)
  - [Flux](./gitops/flux.md)
  - [ArgoCD](./gitops/argocd.md)
