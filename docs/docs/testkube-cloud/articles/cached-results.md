# Cached Test Results

The Testkube cached test results allows you to see and inspect test execution results even when your Testkube agent is offline.

## Overview

![offline-main](../../img/offline-list.png)

Testkube Cloud uses test execution data stored in Cloud to allow you inspect past test executions. This feature also works when your agent is online, but the Testkube agent doesn't have the test definition available in Kubernetes.

Cached test results appear with read-only tag. These test cannot be updated. If you want to get rid of old test, you can go to Test Settings page and click "Delete Test".
