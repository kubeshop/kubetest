## Incidents

Testkube Status Pages streamlines the incident management processes by providing a central platform for incident tracking, communication, and documentation. It is a critical aspect of Testkube Status Pages, and it involves the communication processes and procedures for detecting, reporting, and resolving issues or incidents that affect the availability or performance of your software or services. This helps teams respond to incidents more efficiently, maintain transparency with stakeholders, and continuously improve their incident response procedures to ensure the reliability of their software or services.

In the first released phase, Incidents are simple objects responsible for communication between the service providers and their users. Managing them is as easy as creating them via the Status Pages management page.

## Best Practices

Best practices are essential for effectively using Testkube Status Pages to communicate the status of your software projects. These practices help ensure that your status pages are informative, reliable, and serve their intended purpose. Here are some best practices for Testkube Status Pages:

### Designing Effective Status Pages

Clear and Concise Information: Keep the information on your status page clear, concise, and relevant. Avoid technical jargon that might confuse non-technical stakeholders.

Use Visuals: Utilize the visual element test status indicators to make it easier for users to understand the current status at a glance.

Test Grouping: Group related tests logically, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the status of different parts of your software services.

Real-Time Updates: Ensure that incident update are added in real-time to reflect the most current information.

Incident History: Maintain a visible incident history or log so users can review past incidents and resolutions.

### Incident Response Guidelines

Defined Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of team members involved in incident response. This includes incident commanders, communicators, and technical responders.

Incident Severity Levels: Establish a clear and consistent system for categorizing incident severity levels. This helps prioritize response efforts. The levels provided by Testkube are: critical, major, minor, low, info.

Communication Plan: Develop a communication plan that outlines how and when to communicate with stakeholders during incidents. Ensure that communication is timely, transparent, and accurate.

Escalation Procedures: Define procedures for escalating incidents when they cannot be resolved at lower levels. Identify when and how to involve senior management or additional resources.

Post-Incident Reviews: Conduct post-incident reviews (post-mortems) after each incident to analyze what went well and what could be improved. Use these reviews to update incident response procedures.

### Regular Maintenance

Scheduled Updates: Regularly update the status page, even during periods of normal operation. This demonstrates that the page is actively maintained and reliable.

Test Alerting: Periodically test your alerting and incident response mechanisms to ensure they are functioning correctly.

Documentation Updates: Keep documentation related to your status pages up-to-date, including service descriptions, contact information, and incident response procedures.

Training: Ensure that team members involved in incident response are adequately trained and up-to-date with best practices.

### User Engagement

Stakeholder Awareness: Promote awareness of the status page among your stakeholders, including both internal teams and external users.

Feedback Loop: Encourage users to provide feedback on the status page's usefulness and clarity. Use this feedback to make improvements.

### Custom Slugs Configuration

Custom Slugs: If applicable, configure custom slugs for your status pages to match your brand and make them more accessible to users.

These best practices will help you maximize the effectiveness of Testkube Status Pages, ensuring that it serves as a valuable communication tool for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. By following these guidelines, you can maintain transparency, respond efficiently to incidents, and provide a reliable source of information about the status of your software projects.
