In summary, you now have Testkube setup in your Kubernetes cluster, ready to discover the Testkube features:
- The Testkube CLI allows you to locally port forward to the kube dashboard deployment.
- The Testkube CLI allows you to interact with the Testkube server components through k8s CRs or REST API calls made through the [kube apiserver proxy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/proxies/).

As usage of Testkube grows within your team, you may choose to:
* Leverage [managed Testkube cloud](../testkube-cloud/articles/intro.md).
* [Move to production](./going-to-production.md) with your own Testkube installation.
