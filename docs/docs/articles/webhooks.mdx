# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to integrate Testkube with external systems by sending HTTP POST payloads containing information about Testkube executions and their current state when specific events occur. To set up webhooks in Testkube, you'll need to have an HTTPS endpoint to receive the events and a payload template to be sent along with the data.

## Creating a Webhook
The webhook can be created using the Dashboard, CLI, or a Custom Resource.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">
If you prefer to use the Dashboard, you can view existing webhooks by going to the Webhooks tab.

![Dashboard menu - webhooks icon](../img/dashboard-webhooks-icon.png)

Here you can also create a new webhook by clicking the `Create a new webhook` button.

Then, fill in the webhook details:
![Dashboard webhook - create dialog 1](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-1.png)
- Name - your webhook name (in this case `example-webhook`)
- Resource identifier - the resource (or resources) selected by `label` for which the webhook can be triggered (in the example: `test-type:postman-collection` - any postman test)
- Triggered events - events that will trigger the webhook (in this case `start-test`, `end-test-success`, and `end-test-failed`). All available trigger events can be found in the [Supported Event types](#supported-event-types) section.

![Dashboard webhook - create dialog 2](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-2.png)

Set your webhook URI - the HTTPS endpoint where you want to receive the webhook events.
After the webhook is created, the custom payload and headers can be set in Settings->Action.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Webhooks can be created with Testkube CLI using the `create webhook` command.

```sh
testkube create webhook --name example-webhook --events start-test --events end-test-success --events end-test-failed --uri <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
```
`--name` - Your webhook name (in this case `example-webhook`).
`--events` - Event that will trigger a webhook. Multiple `--events` can be defined (in this case `--events start-test --events end-test-success --events end-test-failed`). All available trigger events can be found in the [Supported Event types](#supported-event-types) section.
`--uri` - The HTTPS endpoint where you want to receive the webhook events.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
```
Where <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL> should be replaced with the HTTPS endpoint URL where you want to receive the webhook events.

And then apply with:

```sh
kubectl apply -f webhook.yaml
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Resource Selector (labels)
In order to limit webhook triggers to a specific resource, or resources, the Resource Selector can be used. It allows you to select the specific resource by label, or labels.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">

![Dashboard webhook - resource identifier](../img/dashboard-create-webhook-resource-identifier.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

The Resource Selector can be set with `--selector`.
For example, `--selector test-type=postman-collection` will limit the resources to the postman tests (label: `test-type=postman-collection`)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml
spec:
  selector: test-type=postman-collection
```

So, the complete definition may look like this:

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: test-type=postman-collection
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Webhook Payload

Webhook payload can be configured - in this example, `event id`:
```
{"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">
Webhook payload can be configured in Webhook Settings->Action

![Dashboard webhook - webhook settings action`](../img/dashboard-webhook-settings-action.png)

![Dashboard webhook - webhook payload](../img/dashboard-webhook-payload.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Create a webhook payload template file:

```json title="template.json"
{
  "text": "event id {{ .Id }}"
}
```

And set it with `--payload-template template.json`.

```sh
testkube create webhook --name example-webhook --events start-test --events end-test-passed --events end-test-failed --payload-template template.json --uri <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
```
Where <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL> should be replaced with the HTTPS endpoint URL where you want to receive the webhook events.


```sh title="Expected output:"
Webhook created example-webhook ðŸ¥‡
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

Payload template can be configured with `spec.payloadTemplate`.
```
  payloadTemplate: |
    {"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

Example:
```
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
  payloadObjectField: ""
  payloadTemplate: |
    {"text": "event id {{ .Id }}"}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Webhook Payload Variables
Webhook payload can contain **event-specific** variables - they will be replaced with actual data when the events occurs. In the above examples, only the event `Id` is being sent. 
However, any of these [supported Event Variables](#supported-event-variables) can be used.

For example, the following payload:
```
{"text": "Event {{ .Type_ }} - Test '{{ .TestExecution.TestName }}' execution ({{ .TestExecution.Number }}) finished with '{{ .TestExecution.ExecutionResult.Status }}' status"}
```
will result in:
```
{"text": "Event end-test-success - Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (948) finished with 'passed' status"}
```

#### testkube-api-server ENV variables
In addition to Event-specific variables it's also possible to pass testkube-api-server ENV variables:

```sh title="template.txt"
TESTKUBE_CLOUD_URL: {{ index .Envs "TESTKUBE_CLOUD_URL" }}
```

### HTTP Headers
You can add additional HTTP headers like `Authorization` or `x-api-key` to have a secret token.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="dash" label="Dashboard">

Webhook headers can be configured in Webhook Settings->Action.

![Dashboard webhook - webhook settings action`](../img/dashboard-webhook-settings-action.png)

![Dashboard webhook - webhook headers](../img/dashboard-webhook-headers.png)

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
Custom headers can be set using `--header` - for example:

`--header X-Token="12345"`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="crd" label="Custom Resource">

```yaml
spec:
  headers:
    X-Token: "12345"
```

```yaml title="webhook.yaml"
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  uri: <YOUR_ENDPOINT_URL>
  events:
    - start-test
    - end-test-success
    - end-test-failed
  selector: ""
  headers:
    X-Token: "12345"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Additional examples

### Microsoft Teams
Webhooks can also be used to send messages to Microsoft Teams channels.
First, you need to create an incoming webhook at Teams for specific channel. You can check how to do it at Teams Docs [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet#create-incoming-webhooks-1). After your Teams incoming webhook is created, you can use it with Testkube webhooks - just use the URL provided (will probably look like this: `https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/xxxxxxxxx`).

In order to send the message when test execution finished, the following Webhook can be used:
```
apiVersion: executor.testkube.io/v1
kind: Webhook
metadata:
  name: example-webhook-teams
  namespace: testkube
spec:
  events:
  - end-test-success
  - end-test-failed
  - end-test-aborted
  - end-test-timeout
  uri: https://xxxxx.webhook.office.com/xxxxxxxxx
  payloadTemplate: "{\"text\": \"Test '{{ .TestExecution.TestName }}' execution ({{ .TestExecution.Number }}) finished with '{{ .TestExecution.ExecutionResult.Status }}' status\"}\n"
```

It will result in:

```
{"text": "Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (949) finished with 'passed' status"}
```

and message:
`Test 'postman-executor-smoke' execution (949) finished with 'passed' status"` being displayed.

## Testing Webhooks

If you are just getting started and want to test your webhook configuration, you can use public and free services that act as HTTP catch-all apps. Here are a couple of options:

1. [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/): Beeceptor allows you to quickly capture HTTP payloads, review them in real time, and send desired HTTP responses as you test your webhooks. You can use its local-tunnel feature when you want to test payloads against a service running on localhost.
2. [Webhook.Site](https://webhook.site/): Webhook.Site provides an easy way to capture HTTP payloads, review the headers and body for the incoming requests, and automatically respond with a `200 OK` status code.

By using these services, you can quickly set up an HTTP endpoint to receive webhook payloads during your testing/development process.
