# Uninstalling Testkube

You can follow one of the two procedures below to uninstall Testkube. You might need to repeat this process in case you deployed the control plane and one or more agents in different clusters or namespaces.

### Uninstalling with the Testkube CLI

You can use the CLI to uninstall Testkube:

```bash
testkube uninstall
```

If you installed testkube in another namespace than the default `testkube` namespace, make sure to pass that namespace as an argument to the `uninstall` command. Learn more [here](https://docs.testkube.io/cli/testkube_uninstall) or execute `testkube uninstall --help`.

```go
testkube uninstall --namespace my-testkube-namespace
```

### Uninstalling with Helm

You can use Helm to uninstall Testkube:

```bash
helm uninstall testkube
```
