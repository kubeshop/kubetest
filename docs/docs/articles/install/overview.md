# About Installing Testkube

:::info
**Testkube Cloud** is a solution that manages the Testkube control plane for you.
It also helps you manage agent installations so you can skip most of these installing articles if you decide to use it.

Visit [the app][testkube-cloud] or [learn more][testkube-architectures] in our reference architectures.
:::

You can install Testkube by using one of the following deployment options:

- Use [the Testkube Quickstart][testkube-quickstart] to evaluate a preconfigured on-prem demo.
- Use [the Testkube CLI][testkube-cli] for an out-of-the-box experience.
- Use [the Testkube Helm Chart][testkube-helm] to configure production-ready deployment.

Testkube consists of two sub-systems: the control plane and agent(s). Please take a look at [the reference architectures][testkube-architectures] to better understand the high-level workings of Testkube and to discover which setup fits your needs.
