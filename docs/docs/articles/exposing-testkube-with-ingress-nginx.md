# Ingress-NGINX

## Prerequisites

1. Deploy NGINX Ingress Controller into your k8s cluster. Please see the link for more details: [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/).

2. (Optional) To use TLS it is required to have any certificate management tool installed. At Testkube and in this guide we will use [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), but it might differ depending on your set-up.

3. Add Testkube helm-chart to your repositories, using this command:
```sh
helm repo add kubeshop https://kubeshop.github.io/helm-charts && helm repo update
```

## Exposing Testkube 

In order to expose Testkube to the outside world we need to enable two Ingresses -  Testkube's UI API and Testkube's dashboard. Update `values.yaml` file that later will be passed to the `helm install` command. To enable the Testkube Ingresses, please use the following code configuration:

```aidl
testkube-api:
  uiIngress:
    enabled: true
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "false"
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
      nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
      cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
      acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
    path: /results/(v\d/.*)
    hosts:
      - your-host.com
    tlsenabled: "true"
    tls: 
      - hosts:
         - your-host.com
      secretName: testkube-cert-secret


testkube-dashboard:
  ingress:
    enabled: "true"
    annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/force-ssl-redirect: "false"
       nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
       cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
       acme.cert-manager.io/http01-edit-in-place: "true"
  path: /
  hosts:
    - your-host.com
  tlsenabled: "true"
  tls: 
    - hosts:
        - your-host.com
      secretName: testkube-cert-secret
      
  apiServerEndpoint: "your-host.com/results"
```

:::note

Keep in mind that hosts have to be identical for the `dashboard` and for the `api` with different paths though. 

Also, do not forget to add `apiServerEndpoint` to the `values.yaml` for the `testkube-dashboard`, e.g.: apiServerEndpoint: "your-host.com/results".

:::

Please note that the snippet includes annotations for cert manager as well. Certificates are automatically generated using Let's Encrypt and cert-manager, but can be configured for any particular case. If there is no need for a TLS (Transport Layer Security) to be enabled, omit the TLS configuration.

:::important

We highly discourage working in a non-safe environment which is exposed without the use of a TLS-based connection. Please do so in a private internal environment for testing or development purposes only.

:::

## Deployment
Once the `values.yaml` file is ready, we can deploy Testkube into a cluster:

```aidl
helm install --create-namespace testkube kubeshop/testkube --namespace testkube --values values.yaml
```

After installation is completed you may get the address of the Ingresses with the following commands:

```sh
kubectl get ingress -n testkube
```

By default, the API's entry point is the path `/results`, so the results will be accessible at `$INGRESS_HOST/results/`

The Ingress configuration used is available in the [Testkube Helm Repo](https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts).

A values file for guidance can be found [here](https://github.com/kubeshop/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/testkube/values-demo.yaml#L334).
