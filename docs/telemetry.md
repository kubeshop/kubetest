# Telemetry

To improve the end-user experience, Testkube collects anonymous data about usage.

Participation in this program is optional. You may [opt-out](#how-to-opt-out) if you'd prefer not to share any information.

The data collected is always anonymous, not traceable to the source, and only used in aggregate form. 

Telemetry collects and scrambles information about the host when the API server is bootstrapped for the first time. 

The collected data looks like this.
