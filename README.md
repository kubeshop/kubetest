# Welcome to TestKube - your friendly Kubernetes testing framework

TestKube decouples test artifacts and execution from CI/CD tooling. 
Tests such as Postman, Cypress, or others are stored as part of your clusters state and can be executed as needed:

- Manually via kubectl cli
- Externally triggered via API (CI, external tooling, etc)
- Automatically on deployment of annotated/labeled services/pods/etc (WIP)

TestKube helps to:

- Avoid vendor lock-in for test orchestration and execution in CI/CD  pipelines
- Make it easy to orchestrate and run any kind of tests - functional, load/performance, security, compliance, etc. in your clusters, without having to wrap them in docker-images or providing network access
- Make it possible to decouple test execution from build processes; engineers should be able to run specific tests whenever needed
- Centralize all test results in a consistent format for "actionable QA analytics"
- Provide a modular architecture for adding new types of test scripts and executors

Main TestKube components are:

- kubectl TestKube plugin - simple - installed w/o 3rd party repositories (like Krew etc), communicates with
- API Server - work orchestrator, runs executors, gather execution results
- [CRDs Operator](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-operator) - watches TestKube CR, handles changes, communicates with API Server
- Executors - runs tests defined for specific runner
  - [Postman Executor](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-postman) - runs Postman Collections
  - [Cypress Executor](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-cypress) - runs Cypress Tests
  - [Curl Executor](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-curl) - runs simple Curl commands
  - [Executor Template](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-executor-template) - for creating your own executors
- Results DB - for centralized test results aggregation and analysis
- [TestKube Dashboard](https://github.com/kubeshop/testkube-dashboard) - standalone web application for viewing real-time TestKube test results
